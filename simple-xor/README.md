This is a simple XOR algorithm. 

You can either 1) encrypt, or 2) decrypt the given input file (program [-e, -d] input_file).

The algorithm encrypts the plaintexts by XOR'ing it with a given key (./keys/main_key.key),
and decrypts the ciphertext by the same operation.

The user is encouraged to enter in a custom key, and storing it in ./keys as main_key.key.

Next steps are:

1) automatic key generation
2) secure message/key transfer between parties.
